# SchwabOAuth
c# implementation for OAuth access token and for refresh token.
To use these files, you need a developer account at Shwab. You can create an account at https://developer.schwab.com/.
You will also need access to a trading account at Schwab.

The authorization and refresh folders each  contain a simple c# console application. The only modification needed to run it is to insert the values associated with with the application you've registered with Schwab.

I take no responsibility for the use of this code. Use at your own risk. It is only for the purpose of learning how OAuth works at Schwab.
